This is (or will be) a FUSE filesystem capable of using Spotify for
streaming music.
Currently its in a pre-alpha proof of concept stage.

Usage:

0. Compile

"make" in the source dir. You will need to have your despofity and FUSE libs/headers in place.

1. Mount the filesystem

Example:
mkdir /tmp/spotifs
./spotfy /tmp/spotifs

2. Use

Filesystem structure:

Playlists/
Starred/
Search/

2.1 Browsing playlists
Browsing playlists can be done by doing a directory listing

More to come 

DONE:
- Hacked together filesystem structure
- Rough playlist browsing
- Filesize estimation
- Streaming playback of tracks from the playlist
- WAV header for PCM

TODO:
- Impement a proper file system structure
- Implement starred (favourite) tracks
- Implemnet searching with mkdir
- Look at the possibility of returning OGG/MP3 instead of RAW PCM?
- Cover art for albums
